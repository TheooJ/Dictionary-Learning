    "### 1.1 One dictionary to learn them all\n",
    "\n",
    "In the classical setting of dictionary learning, we consider a signal $\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ and we want to represent it in a basis in which it has a sparse representation. The key idea is to write $\\mathbf{x}$ as a linear combination of $k$ other vectors lying in $\\mathbb{R}^N$, called _atoms_ of a predefined _dictionary_. Such a dictionary will be denoted by a matrix $\\mathbf{D}=[\\mathbf{d}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{d}_k ] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times k}$, and we want to find the coefficients $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_k$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\alpha_i \\mathbf{d}_i$ is relatively close to $\\mathbf{x}$ in $\\ell_2$-norm. More precisely, we aim at minimizing : \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to enforce a sparse representation of $\\mathbf{x}$ in such a dictionary, we penalize the $\\ell_1$-norm of the $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$'s as in the LASSO estimator. We denote $l(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{D})$ the optimal value of the $\\ell_1$-_sparse coding_ problem :\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the dictionary, we usually have access to $n$ observations following a distribution $p(\\mathbf{x})$, stored in $\\mathbf{X} = [\\mathbf{x}_1, \\dots ,\\mathbf{x}_n] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times n} $, and we then minimize the _empirical risk_ $f_n(\\mathbf{D}) = \\dfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n l(\\mathbf{x}_i,\\mathbf{D})$. Recall that we aim at minimizing the _expected  risk_ $f(\\mathbf{D}) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbf{x}}[l(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{D})]$ which is linked to $f_n$ by $f(\\mathbf{D}) = \\underset{n \\to + \\infty}{\\lim} f_n(\\mathbf{D})$.\n",

Adaptive dictionaries were thus introduced in recent years to learn the dictionary instead of using a predefined one, and the optimization now seeks to find the coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ as well as the dictionary $\\mathbf{D}$.\n",

    "### 4.2 Dictionaries in Topological Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the core tools in topological data analysis (TDA) is the persistence diagram. It is an object that encapsulates a simple topological signature of complex objects, typically compact submanifolds of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ Here the sparsity lies in the fact that we can represent some very complicated topological objects by a much simpler _summary_. The point here is not to delve into the details of TDA, but to show a less straightforward use of dictionary learning. One of the key ideas of TDA is to only store compact representations of data instead of the data itself. This idea is viable due to the fact that persistence diagrams enjoy a lot of stability properties that makes them \"good\" representations of the data in some sense. Once the space of persistence diagrams is endowed with a metric, it is then possible to define the notion of dictionaries and mixing coefficients just like in the classical euclidean setting, with the general notion of dictionary and coefficients explained above.

    "In dictionary learning, the goal is to find a _sparse_ representation of a vector $\\mathbf{x}$ in a dictionary $\\mathbf{D}$, that is to say, $\\mathbf{x} \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^k \\alpha_i \\mathbf{d}_i$. In recent works, we aim at finding both the dictionary $\\mathbf{D}$ and the coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We presented two algorithms for adaptive dictionary learning : supervised dictionary learning and online dictionary learning. The first one aims at learning both a classifier and the dictionary with the associated coefficients, while the latter proposes an alternative to batch methods which can be computationally intensive in high-dimension. We fully implemented the two algorithms and showed that the second one was able to learn the sparse representation of $\\mathbf{x}$. Our first algorithm works on a toy example but takes too long to converge with a real dataset."
